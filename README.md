This is an augmented AVL tree implementation written in Python that helps to store intervals and search for intervals that include a given point. This can be achieved in a runtime complexity of O(log n) since the AVL tree is a self-balancing tree.

I wrote this tree as part of a coding challenge when interviewing for a company.
